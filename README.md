# JavaScript Console Finances

## Description

This project takes a list of profit and losses of a company over 86 months and produces a fact sheet, listing the net profit, the average change, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits/losses. I enjoyed working on this project and it helped me solidfy a lot of the concepts introduced in class, particularly how the for loop works.

## Credits

In addition to the following links, the class sessions held by the edX front-end bootcamp team have represented most of my understanding of JavaScript. I also have some previous experience with Java, which has in some places helped me understand JavaScript.
